# Final Design Independent Verification 02 — Correction Resolution

Status: **CORRECTIONS IMPLEMENTED — INDEPENDENT REVIEWER RE-VERIFICATION REQUIRED.**

This is a Main-Research correction record responding to
`reviews/final_design_independent_verification_02.md`. It does not close the
independent verification.

## FDV2-B01 — JAEA source-variant conflation

### Finding
The frozen design mixed the 170 MWth / ~202 MWe GTHTR300C variant with the
Nishihara 2007 370 MWth / 88 MWe economic configuration.

### Root cause
Hardware precedent and economic-source quantities from two GTHTR300C variants
were treated as one architecture.

### Correction
The final mature architecture is now explicitly Nishihara 2007:
- 600 MWth reactor;
- 370 MWth source hydrogen/IHX branch;
- 230 MWth complementary source power branch;
- 88 MWe source gross electricity;
- 59.7 bn JPY reference plant cost;
- 0.52 JPY/MJ heat;
- 4.9 JPY/kWh electricity;
- 85% availability.

The INL process draws 176.8 MWth, below the 370 MWth source heat branch.
The project maps the residual 423.2 MWth through the source-implied
88/230 gross conversion, giving 161.92 MWe gross. After 17.3 MWe process
demand, net export is 144.62 MWe.

The 70.9 bn JPY / 0.57 JPY/MJ / 5.5 JPY/kWh case is now labelled only as
Nishihara's doubled-IHX/secondary-loop COST sensitivity. No capacity claim is
made from it.

### Primary-source evidence
Nishihara, Mouri and Kunitomi (2007), ICONE15-10157, reports a 600 MWth
GTHTR300C whose hydrogen production plant uses 370 MWth. The source economic
configuration and associated cost sensitivity are kept separate from the
historical 170/202 variant.

### Numerical impact
Principal reference mapping:
- process heat: 176.8 MWth;
- residual power thermal: 423.2 MWth;
- gross electricity: 161.92 MWe;
- net export: 144.62 MWe;
- annual net export: ~1.077 TWh/y.

Corrected reference-economics screens:
- zero electricity value: ~S$3.45m/y, ~S$3.76/tCO2e;
- S$100/MWh: ~-S$104.23m/y, ~-S$113.65/t;
- S$150/MWh: ~-S$158.07m/y, ~-S$172.35/t;
- S$200/MWh: ~-S$211.92m/y, ~-S$231.06/t.
Doubled-cost sensitivity at S$150/MWh: ~-S$162.29/t.

### Tests
Added source-variant identity, reactor thermal closure, source-efficiency gross
power derivation, net export, zero-value and doubled-cost tests.

### Acceptance status
**IMPLEMENTED; awaiting CI and Independent Reviewer acceptance.**

## FDV2-M01 — lifecycle intensity factor-of-1000

### Finding
The frozen implementation multiplied a tCO2e/tH2 ratio by 1000 even though
t/t and kg/kg are numerically identical.

### Correction
Removed the factor 1000. Added dimensional regression test.

### Numerical impact
Candidate lifecycle intensity under the preserved proxy boundary is
approximately **1.95 kgCO2e/kgH2**, not ~1,953.

The independently reproduced ~917,139 tCO2e/y lifecycle-abatement result is
unchanged.

### Tests
`lifecycle_ci_units_are_correct` requires the corrected result to lie near
1.9-2.1 kg/kg.

### Acceptance status
**IMPLEMENTED; awaiting CI and Independent Reviewer acceptance.**

## FDV2-M02 — integrated thermal/power state

### Finding
The frozen design independently inserted INL process heat, a 585 C return
assumption and 202 MWe from a different JAEA variant.

### Correction
The evidence layers are now explicit:
- INL chemical process: 176.8 MWth; 900 C supply; ~466 C return; source flow
  78.49 kg/s; 17.3 MWe process electricity.
- JAEA/Nishihara hardware economics: 600/370/230 MWth and 88 MWe source split.
- Project integration: 176.8 MWth process draw, 423.2 MWth residual power
  branch, 161.92 MWe gross using the source 88/230 conversion, 144.62 MWe net.

Constant-Cp helium screening with 900/466 C gives ~78.34 kg/s, within 0.2% of
the INL source flow.

### Tests
Added reactor thermal-balance closure, INL helium-flow source check, gross
electric derivation and net-export derivation.

### Acceptance status
**IMPLEMENTED; awaiting CI and Independent Reviewer acceptance.**

## Preserved scientific result

The independently reproduced INL process basis was not changed:
- 97,946.015 tH2/y;
- 862,093.803 tCO2/y direct avoided;
- ~917,138.896 tCO2e/y lifecycle avoided under the declared proxy boundary.

## Required handoff

Do not close this review here.

After Research CI, Paper CI, generated-result regeneration and PDF inspection
are complete, return this corrected state to the Independent Reviewer. The
Independent Reviewer must determine whether FDV2-B01/M01/M02 now satisfy the
verification acceptance criteria.


## Final bounded corrective pass — B01 / M02 / manuscript build

This update responds to the frozen corrective re-review. It does not close independent verification.

### FDV2-B01
The last active 170-MW/doubled-capacity rationale has been removed from the current manuscript. The selected current architecture is consistently Nishihara et al. (2007): 600 MWth reactor, 370 MWth source heat/IHX branch and 88 MWe source electricity at the published source split. The doubled-loop case remains only an adverse COST sensitivity.

### FDV2-M02
The unsupported project extrapolation 423.2*(88/230)=161.92 MWe and the resulting 144.62 MWe export claim have been removed from the canonical final-design calculation and current documentation.

The final thermal statement is deliberately bounded:
- process duty = 176.8 MWth;
- source heat branch = 370 MWth, therefore sufficient in capacity;
- reactor rating = 600 MWth;
- remaining thermal capacity = 423.2 MWth;
- INL process helium state = approximately 900/466 C and 78.49 kg/s;
- constant-Cp verification screen = approximately 78.34 kg/s;
- no exact project off-design gross/net/export MWe is claimed.

The Nishihara 88 MWe value is retained only as the source configuration and as part of recovering the full published source economic burden. It is not asserted as project export.

### Controlling zero-value economics
The controlling economic case now assigns project electricity export value = S$0/MWh. The full selected source-product economic burden is charged using the source 370 MWth heat product and source 88 MWe generation at their published unit costs, so reactor capacity is not treated as free. CCS, integration, T&S and natural-gas terms remain included.

Hand reconstruction gives approximately S$3.42 million/y incremental and S$3.72/tCO2e before generator rounding. The approximately 917,139 tCO2e/y lifecycle result and resolved approximately 1.95 kgCO2e/kgH2 intensity are preserved.

### FDV2-M01
Preserved. The factor-of-1000 error remains removed and the dimensional regression test remains in place.

### FDV2-RR-B01
The fatal manuscript issue was traced to unsafe raw dollar signs in prose (for example S$100--200/MWh), which left TeX in math mode and surfaced as `Missing $ inserted` at the next section boundary. Current corrected prose uses escaped currency notation. Paper CI must still pass before this correction can be considered verified.

### Handoff status
Corrections implemented. Research CI, Paper CI and exact PDF visual verification are required before handoff to the Independent Reviewer. Only the Independent Reviewer may close FDV2-B01/M01/M02 and declare the final design verified.
