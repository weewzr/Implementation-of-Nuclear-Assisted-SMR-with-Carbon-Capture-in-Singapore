# Independent Review 2 resolution record

## Decision

Independent Review 2 gate: **OPEN**.

This file reconciles the existing Independent Review 2 against the current
repository state. It is not a new review. Findings are not reopened merely
because this file was stale; dispositions below follow the original Review-2
acceptance criteria and current implementation/CI evidence.

## R2-B01 — Full-species physical recycle/purge/reformer/WGS/PSA steady state

**Final disposition: RESOLVED.**

### Scientific correction
The failed simultaneous proportional-controller recycle solve was replaced by a
nested formulation: an inner fixed-fresh solve converges the full WetGas6
(H2/H2O/CO/CO2/CH4/N2) recycle state, while an outer bracketed scalar solve
closes fixed H2 product. The inert purge is imposed from the steady-state N2
balance rather than an instantaneous composition switch.

The predictive path was subsequently strengthened further: arbitrary SMR
conversion was removed and replaced by coupled ideal-gas SMR/WGS equilibrium at
declared reformer T/P, followed by the lower-temperature shift and PSA/purge
loop.

### Code/equation location
`model/src/lib.rs`:
- `WetGas6`, `apply_smr`, `apply_wgs`, `wet6_element_residual`;
- `solve_smr_equilibrium`, `solve_smr_wgs_equilibrium`;
- `solve_recycle6_at_fixed_fresh_thermo`;
- `solve_full_recycle6_nested_thermo`;
- steady-state purge relation `purge_N2 = fresh external N2`.

### Validation evidence
- C/H/O/N conservation is checked across reaction steps.
- Nonnegative species are required.
- Fixed-H2 product is solved as an explicit outer residual.
- Nonzero source N2 produces a finite purge.
- Fresh-feed demand responds to reformer temperature rather than remaining
  structurally invariant.
- The failed early solver remains in git history as falsification evidence and
  is not the canonical predictive solver.

R2-B01 is closed.

## R2-B02 — Integrated temperature-resolved candidate energy balance

**Final disposition: RESOLVED.**

### Scientific correction
The candidate energy balance has now been rebuilt on the canonical
thermodynamic full-species recycle state; it no longer uses the retired 0.737
fresh-feed fraction or the representative 162 MWth midpoint.

A new `WetGas6` total-enthalpy function evaluates the solved mixed
fresh+recycle reformer inlet and the coupled SMR/WGS equilibrium outlet with
interval-safe species thermochemistry. The reformer external heat is obtained
directly from

`Q_reformer = H_out(T_reformer) - H_in(T_inlet)`.

Because total stream enthalpy already contains formation/reaction and sensible
contributions, no separate reaction term is added. This removes the previous
risk of reaction/sensible double counting.

The actual solved reformer outlet is then cooled to the published 320 C HTS
temperature to report downstream WHB heat recovery as a separate heat-recovery
term. It is not subtracted from radiant reformer duty. Incremental MDEA
regeneration remains a source-bounded term whose helper already credits bounded
recoverable residual shift heat, so WHB heat is not subtracted a second time.

The candidate nuclear process-heat interval is therefore the closed high-grade
reformer external duty plus the bounded incremental capture-regeneration duty,
not an inserted 162 MWth assumption.

### Code/equation location
`model/src/lib.rs`:
- `wet6_enthalpy_mw`;
- `thermo_reference_reformer_states`;
- `CandidateEnergyLedger`;
- `candidate_energy_ledger`.

### Validation evidence
The ledger is evaluated at reformer-inlet temperatures 600, 650 and 700 C on
the same canonical thermodynamic recycle solution. The balance residual is
explicitly checked, downstream WHB recovery is positive, hotter inlet
temperature reduces required external reformer heat, and the resulting
high-side nuclear process duty remains below the retained 170 MW JAEA IHX
capacity screen.

### CI/test evidence
Commit `82b0e23734ccff15067df874e871f785a889a807`.
GitHub Actions run 36536997329: **PASS**.

Tests verify:
- exact numerical closure of `Q_reformer-(H_out-H_in)`;
- positive reformer external duty and WHB recovery;
- monotonic reduction of reformer duty with hotter inlet;
- use of the non-legacy solved fresh-feed state;
- candidate high-side nuclear duty below the benchmark IHX capacity.

### Acceptance-criterion status
- temperature-resolved conventional reference: **PASS**
- candidate heat cascade based on current full-species recycle: **PASS**
- no double counting across reaction/sensible/recovery terms: **PASS**
- nuclear heat duty obtained from closed-balance residual rather than inserted
  midpoint: **PASS**
- automated CI closure tests: **PASS**

## R2-B03 — Thermodynamic property-range handling

**Final disposition: RESOLVED.**

### Scientific correction
Property objects carry explicit NIST Shomate validity metadata. H2 dispatches
between 298-1000 K and 1000-2500 K sets; CO2 dispatches between 298-1200 K and
1200-6000 K sets. SMR/WGS equilibrium functions use interval-safe dispatch.

### Code/equation location
`model/src/lib.rs`: `ShomateRange`, `H2_LOW`, `H2_HIGH`,
`CO2_LOW`, `CO2_HIGH`, `h2_shomate`, `co2_shomate`,
`smr_equilibrium_constant_piecewise`,
`wgs_equilibrium_constant_piecewise`.

### Validation evidence
Boundary continuity, invalid-temperature rejection, high-temperature reformer
dispatch and independent external SMR K(T) checks are implemented.

### CI/test evidence
Commits:
- `897353f09fedaba27b950c51671c04e21fa70339`
- `4e0e65943bbd75e1efb9de3cef13e67fc752190c`
- `0ee42368b7b13b43edf0c035cd50932144ee6609`

### Acceptance-criterion status
- no out-of-range Shomate use: **PASS**
- boundary continuity/fit behaviour: **PASS**
- independent K(T) check: **PASS**
- 1173-1223 K reformer tests: **PASS**
- explicit invalid-temperature failure: **PASS**

R2-B03 is closed.

## R2-M01 — Candidate-specific CCS scaling

**Final disposition: RESOLVED.**

### Scientific correction
The stream-specific CCS topology is now coupled to candidate-specific duty
scaling on the canonical thermodynamic recycle state. The solved shifted-gas
CO2 throughput and purge CO/CH4 carbon (oxidized before capture) are calculated
directly from the same converged state used by R2-B02.

IEAGHG Case-2A source duties are converted to throughput-specific anchors using
the reconstructed source tail-CO2 flow. MDEA regeneration heat and final CO2
compression/dehydration scale with total candidate CO2 sent to capture. The
low-pressure tail-feed compressor is scaled only with the purge/tail route;
high-pressure shifted syngas does not incorrectly inherit that compressor.

This preserves the physical distinction between high-pressure process capture
and low-pressure tail polishing and avoids a universal amine/compression
penalty.

### Code/equation location
`model/src/lib.rs`:
- `CandidateCcsDutyLedger`;
- `candidate_ccs_duty_ledger`;
- `case2a_mdea_regeneration_latent_heat_bounds_mw`;
- `IEAGHG_CASE2A_CO2_COMP_DEHYDRATION_MWE`;
- `IEAGHG_CASE2A_TAIL_COMP_BRAKE_MW`.

### Validation evidence
The candidate ledger derives CO2 throughput from the converged thermodynamic
reformer/shift/PSA/purge state. Source scaling at unit Case-2A throughput
reproduces the source MDEA and CO2-compression anchors exactly. A separate test
verifies that the low-pressure tail compressor is not applied to the
high-pressure process-CO2 stream.

### CI/test evidence
Commit `92dee56784958dd89652f2c884041d4dd2c44098`.
GitHub Actions run 36537577816: **PASS**.

### Acceptance-criterion status
- stream-specific CCS topology: **PASS**
- carbon disposition/closure: **PASS**
- candidate capture duties scaled from current solved stream state: **PASS**
- IEAGHG source-case duty reproduction on the same scaling formulation:
  **PASS**
- no generic low-pressure compressor assigned to high-pressure syngas: **PASS**

R2-M01 is closed.

## R2-M02 — PSA performance is composition-dependent

**Final disposition: RESOLVED AS BOUNDED SCREENING UNCERTAINTY.**

### Scientific correction
The unsupported universal linear impurity slope is no longer required for the
canonical uncertainty screen. PSA H2 recovery is propagated over a
literature-supported 70-90% envelope with the IEAGHG reconstructed recovery as
the central plant-specific anchor.

### Code/equation location
`model/src/lib.rs`: `PSA_H2_RECOVERY_SCREEN_LO`,
`PSA_H2_RECOVERY_SCREEN_HI`, `psa6_fixed_recovery`,
`solve_recycle6_at_fixed_fresh_psa_recovery`,
`solve_full_recycle6_psa_recovery`,
`psa_recovery_uncertainty_cases`.

### Validation/CI evidence
Commit `5e88e46a5712321db4c89c9442cb85354f98f109` passes CI.
All envelope cases converge at fixed H2 product and lower recovery requires no
less fresh feed.

### Acceptance-criterion status
- composition/PSA uncertainty affects candidate recycle behaviour: **PASS via bounded recovery envelope**
- physically bounded candidate response: **PASS**
- adsorption-cycle prediction: **OUT OF DECLARED SCREENING SCOPE**

## R2-M03 — Independent/system-level falsification tests

**Final disposition: RESOLVED FOR SCREENING-MODEL SCOPE.**

### Scientific correction and evidence
The current suite includes independent/source and limiting-case checks beyond
source-row reconstruction: external SMR K(T), HTS Q/K, apparent-equilibrium
temperature, radiant-duty/WHB validation, C/H/O/N conservation, nonnegative
species, inert closure, fixed-H2 residuals, feasible/infeasible heat-integration
temperature budgets, and PSA-envelope monotonicity.

### Acceptance-criterion status
- external benchmark validation: **PASS**
- integrated mathematical/conservation tests: **PASS**
- falsification retained rather than hidden: **PASS**

This does not convert the screening model into a detailed kinetic/adsorption
plant simulator.

## R2-M04 — Secondary-helium loop closure

**Final disposition: RESOLVED AS A BOUNDED ENGINEERING LOOP.**

### Scientific correction
The secondary-helium flow is now sized from the resolved R2-B02 candidate
high-side nuclear process duty rather than from the 170 MW benchmark itself.

The published JAEA 58 kPa IHX pressure drop remains the only component-specific
source datum. Non-IHX loop losses are not fabricated as point values; they are
explicitly bounded relative to that source anchor:
- process heater/reformer: 0.5-1.5 x IHX drop;
- steam generator/other heat exchangers: 0.25-1.0 x;
- piping/valves/fittings: 0.25-1.0 x.

Together with the IHX, this gives a transparent total-loop pressure-loss
envelope of 2.0-4.5 x the source IHX drop. Circulator power is calculated from
candidate helium mass flow, total pressure loss, source pressure/temperature,
and an explicit 70-80% efficiency bracket.

This closes M04 as a bounded screening loop; it does not claim a detailed
piping/equipment hydraulic design.

### Code/equation location
`model/src/lib.rs`:
- `CandidateHeliumLoopLedger`;
- `candidate_helium_loop_ledger`;
- `helium_loop_delta_p_kpa`;
- `helium_circulator_power_mw`;
- `helium_mass_flow_kg_s`;
- `GTHTR300C_SECONDARY_IHX_DP_KPA`.

### Validation evidence
The full-loop ledger explicitly sums IHX, process, steam-generator/HX and
piping/valve component groups. The high-side pressure loss exceeds the low-side
bound; circulator power and parasitic fraction are positive and ordered. Helium
flow is proven to use the resolved candidate duty rather than the 170 MW source
benchmark.

### CI/test evidence
Commit `f6bc44e52c32107919de4b69f42a05dec8f60294`.
GitHub Actions run 36537837237: **PASS**.

### Acceptance-criterion status
- finite temperature approaches: **PASS**
- benchmark/property-consistent helium heat-carrier calculation: **PASS**
- bounded full-loop pressure loss including non-IHX components: **PASS**
- corresponding bounded full-loop circulator power: **PASS**
- candidate heat duty, not benchmark duty, drives mass flow: **PASS**

R2-M04 is closed.

## R2-M05 — Downstream lifecycle/economic propagation

**Final disposition: OPEN — DEPENDENT MAJOR FINDING.**

### Original scientific issue
Lifecycle/economic conclusions inherited unresolved physical-model assumptions.

### Current scientific state
The legacy 0.737 recycle fraction is explicitly retired from predictive use.
The thermodynamic/purge-aware reference state now feeds a new lifecycle/NG
displacement path, which is a necessary correction.

However, the earlier full-cost/economic screens were built on the retired
reduced recycle fraction and representative 162 MWth duty. They have not been
regenerated from a closed R2-B02 candidate energy ledger, candidate-specific CCS
duties, and closed helium-loop parasitics. Those historical outputs are already
labelled non-current in `STATUS.md`.

No economics are regenerated during this reconciliation.

### Code/equation location
`model/src/lib.rs`: `thermo_recycle_reference_case`,
`thermo_recycle_lifecycle_screen`, `thermo_reference_screen`;
legacy reduced-model economic functions remain provenance only.

### Acceptance-criterion status
- legacy physical basis retired: **PASS**
- lifecycle path accepts corrected physical state: **PASS**
- independent predictive/system tests before integrated conclusions: **PASS for current physical solver**
- downstream lifecycle/economic results regenerated from the final corrected
  physical/energy/CCS/helium ledgers: **OPEN**

## Canonical Review-2 critical path

1. **R2-M05** — regenerate dependent lifecycle/economic outputs from the
   resolved B02/M01/M04 physical ledgers and verify their acceptance tests.

R2-B01, R2-B03, R2-M02 and R2-M03 require no repeated work.

## Reconciliation conclusion

Independent Review 2 gate remains **OPEN**. All Review-2 physical BLOCKER
findings and R2-M01/R2-M04 are resolved. Only dependent R2-M05 remains: final
lifecycle/economic outputs must be regenerated from the corrected physical
ledgers before Review 2 can close.
